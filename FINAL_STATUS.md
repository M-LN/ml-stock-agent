## 🐛 Bugs Fixed During Implementation

### 1. LSTM Scaling Bug (CRITICAL)
**Impact**: ❌ MAE $240 → ✅ MAE $14.53
**Fix**: Added `scaler_y` for target variable

### 2. Multi-Column DataFrame Bug
**Impact**: ❌ ValueError when yfinance returns multi-level columns
**Fix**: Added column flattening in `create_features()`

### 3. Insufficient Data Check
**Impact**: ❌ IndexError with small datasets
**Fix**: Added validation before accessing `X_train.shape[1]`
