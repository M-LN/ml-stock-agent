# ✅ COMPLETED: V2 Models Integration + LSTM Tuning

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. **LSTM v2 Tuning** ✅

**Problem**: Original LSTM had MAE of $201-240 (VERY HIGH)

**Root Cause**: Target variable (Close price) was not scaled, only features were scaled.

**Solution**: 
- Added separate scalers: `scaler_X` for features, `scaler_y` for target
- Reduced sequence length: 60 → 30
- Feature selection: 68 → 20 top features
- Smaller LSTM units: [64, 32] → [32, 16]
- More aggressive dropout: 0.2 → 0.3

**Results**:
```
Before: MAE $240.35, MAPE 98.72%
After:  MAE $14.53, MAPE 5.82%
Improvement: 94% reduction in error! 🎉
```

**File**: `lstm_tuned.py`

### 2. **V2 Model Wrappers** ✅

**Added to `agent_interactive.py`**:
- `train_and_save_rf_v2()` - Random Forest with 67 indicators
- `train_and_save_xgboost_v2()` - XGBoost with features + early stopping
- `train_and_save_lstm_v2()` - Bi-LSTM with Attention
- `get_available_model_versions()` - Returns version info for UI

These functions import from the actual implementation files:
- `ml_training_enhanced.py` for RF and XGBoost
- `lstm_tuned.py` for LSTM

---

### 3. **Streamlit UI Integration** ✅

**Modified `pages/6_🔧_Model_Management.py`**:

**New Features**:
1. **Version Selector** - Choose between v1 (Legacy) and v2 (Enhanced) ⭐
2. **Version Descriptions** - Info boxes explain each version
3. **Version-Aware Training** - Calls correct function based on selection
4. **Version Badges** - Saved models show "🆕 v2" vs "v1 (Legacy)"
5. **V2 Metrics Display** - Shows MAPE and Directional Accuracy

**UI Flow**:
```
User selects model type (RF, XGBoost, LSTM)
↓
UI shows version selector with v1 and v2 options
↓
User selects v2 ⭐ (recommended)
↓
Info box: "RF with 67 technical indicators"
↓
User adjusts parameters
↓
Training calls train_and_save_rf_v2() with use_features=True
↓
Model saved with metadata: model_version="v2_with_features"
↓
Saved models list shows: "🆕 v2 (Enhanced with 67 features)"
```

## 🎮 How to Use

### In Streamlit UI:

1. **Start app**: `streamlit run app.py`

2. **Navigate to Model Management** (🔧 page 6)

3. **Train a V2 model**:
   - Symbol: AAPL (or any)
   - Period: 1y or 2y
   - Model Type: Random Forest / XGBoost / LSTM
   - **Version: Select "v2 (Enhanced)" ⭐**
   - Adjust parameters (defaults are good)
   - Click "Analyze & Prepare Training"
   - Review validation report
   - Click "Confirm and Start Training"

4. **Check saved models**:
   - Should show "🆕 v2 (Enhanced with 67 features)"
   - Displays MAPE and Directional Accuracy
   - Version badge distinguishes from v1

5. **Deploy and use**:
   - Click "🚀 Deploy"
   - Go to "ML Forecast" page
   - Select deployed v2 model
   - Get enhanced predictions!

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### ✅ New Files:
1. `lstm_tuned.py` - Tuned LSTM v2 implementation
2. `test_v2_integration.py` - Integration test script

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### 1. LSTM Scaling Bug (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Target variable not scaled → predictions in wrong range → MAE $240

**Fix**: Added separate `scaler_y` for target, inverse transform predictions

**Impact**: 94% reduction in error

### 2. Insufficient Data Check
**Problem**: Training with 3 months data caused IndexError

**Fix**: Added validation check before accessing `X_train.shape[1]`

**Code**:
```python
if len(X_train) == 0 or (hasattr(X_train, 'shape') and len(X_train.shape) < 2):
    print(f"   ❌ Insufficient data after preparation.")
    return None
```
