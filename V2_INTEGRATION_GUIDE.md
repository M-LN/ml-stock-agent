# V2 Models Integration Guide

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### 1. **LSTM v2 Tuning** ✅
- **File**: `lstm_tuned.py`
- **Improvements**:
  - Reduced sequence length: 60 → 30 (50% reduction)
  - Feature selection: 68 → 20 top features (70% reduction)
  - Smaller LSTM units: [64, 32] → [32, 16] (50% reduction)
  - More aggressive dropout: 0.2 → 0.3
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: Proper target (Close price) scaling
  - Separate scalers for features (scaler_X) and target (scaler_y)

**Results:**
- Original LSTM v1: MAE $201-240 (VERY HIGH ❌)
- Tuned LSTM v2: MAE **$14.53** ✅ (94% improvement!)
